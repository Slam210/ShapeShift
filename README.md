## Description
Our application is crafted to foster connectivity and organization within workout communities. Its user-friendly interface allows for the creation of groups, with the added benefit of enabling the user to take on the role of administrator. Members can then be invited to join, schedules shared, and progress discussed, culminating in a more streamlined and productive fitness community. Employing location services, our app is capable of tracking and documenting workouts. Users are able to identify others presently engaged in exercise at the same gym or locale, facilitating networking and the potential for joint workouts. Additionally, our communication features allow for the exchange of workout tips, motivational messages, and the coordination of group workouts. The app's presence system utilizes Firebase. As such, users can monitor key metrics such as distance covered, calories burned, and other crucial data. This equips them with an accurate understanding of their fitness journey, further amplified by the app's ability to facilitate fitness relationships between members working out in the same area. Our app is an ideal solution for those seeking a supportive fitness community. Whether a novice or seasoned athlete, it can facilitate the achievement of fitness goals. By fostering a sense of inclusivity and improving the overall fitness experience, our app is sure to appeal to all who value fitness and wellness.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
